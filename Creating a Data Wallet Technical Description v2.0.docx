Creating a Data Wallet Technical Description v2.0

The Data Manufacturing Process with Corporate Digital Name Genesis

This document outlines Rootz's Data Manufacturing process for creating data with origin - manufacturing new data objects with their own dedicated Data Wallets. The process ensures secure creation, encryption, and distribution while establishing the genesis foundation that enables everything to get a wallet. The model leverages Corporate Digital Names as the DBA genesis, blockchain infrastructure, IPFS, and the ledger of access to establish ownership, origin, and dynamic control.

Process Overview: From Genesis to Control

The Data Manufacturing process creates the foundational framework that enables all data, systems, and things to have their own cryptographic wallets, providing universal foundations for ownership, origin tracking, access control, and reliability verification.

Genesis Foundation Process Steps

1. DBA Genesis Establishment
The Corporate Digital Name serves as the DBA (Doing Business As) that establishes the original origin for all authorized owners within the organization. This corporate genesis becomes the foundational root that validates and authorizes all business-created systems, products, and data.

• Corporate Digital Name Authority: The business establishes its Digital Name DBA, creating the foundational corporate genesis
• Original Origin Recording: The first genesis block records the corporate authority for all subsequent data manufacturing operations
• Authorization Chain: All manufactured data traces back to this foundational corporate genesis

2. Genesis Identification
Any data object can receive its own unique wallet and Digital Name, establishing the foundational identity in the digital world.

• Data Object Wallet Creation: The system generates a new cryptographic key pair (public and private keys) specifically for the data object
• Unique Digital Name Assignment: Creates a unique wallet identity that enables the data object to participate in the universal wallet ecosystem
• Foundational Identity: This wallet becomes the data object's permanent identity for on-chain tracking and access control

3. Genesis Block Creation
The wallet's genesis transaction permanently records ownership, origin, and foundational context, creating the immutable bedrock for all future interactions.

Owner Genesis Block:
• Records the intended owner's wallet address as the authorized entity
• Establishes ownership foundation in the data wallet's transaction chain
• Creates the immutable proof of authentic ownership

System Origin Block:
• Records the manufacturing system's Corporate Digital Name as the origin authority
• Provides genesis proof of authentic origin for the data object
• Links the data to its creating system through the corporate DBA

4. Dynamic Access Framework
Permissions and rights recorded by owners on the data's chain create the dynamic access control framework that governs how data, systems, and things interact across all platforms and applications.

Symmetric Key Encryption with Access Control:
• Generates symmetric key (AES-256, ChaCha20, or crypto-agile alternatives) for content encryption
• Symmetric key encrypted using the data wallet's public key
• Data Access Record (DAR) creation embedding owner's wallet address in access control ledger

Content Manufacturing with Origin:
• Data content encrypted with symmetric key including origin information
• Corporate Digital Name metadata embedded for provenance tracking
• Encrypted content published to IPFS generating unique decentralized address

5. Secure Instructions Activation
The Digital Name becomes the foundational identifier, enabling universal control and verification for all data across any platform or context.

On-Chain Transaction Recording:
• Transaction recorded from data wallet to owner's wallet
• Embeds IPFS address and either encrypted symmetric key or key server address
• Marks owner's wallet with administrative attribute for smart contract interactions
• Establishes secure instruction capability for dynamic control

6. Owner-Centered Dynamic Control
Once established, the genesis foundation enables dynamic control over the data wallet. The original authority can send authenticated instructions to update access, permissions, or sharing rights in real-time.

Real-Time Authority Actions:
• Dynamic Authorization: Grant, revoke, or modify permissions across the ecosystem
• Secure Instructions: Send authenticated commands to update data access controls
• Proxy Assignment: Owner can assign proxies for delegated management
• Group Management: Proxies can add data to managed groups or collections

Ledger of Access Management:
• All permission changes recorded on the data's blockchain
• Rights travel with the data maintaining owner control
• Full audit trail of access modifications
• Immutable record of authorization changes

7. Owner Access and Quality Control
The owner maintains complete control while ensuring quality and reliability of access.

Secure Access Process:
• Owner views on-chain transactions to retrieve IPFS address and metadata
• Decryption via data wallet's private key (if provided through secure DAR)
• Alternative: Wallet Connect to key server for symmetric key request
• Content presented in secure container with policy enforcement

Security Infrastructure: Safe and Reliable

Privacy Built In
• Quantum-Resistant Foundation: Built with quantum-resistant cryptography ensuring future-proof security
• Private Key Management: Data wallet private keys managed securely or discarded post-creation as appropriate
• Secure Transmission: DAR-based key transmission uses nonce-protected messaging

Genesis of Reliability
• Crypto Agility: Support for multiple encryption algorithms and evolving standards
• On-Chain Integrity: Genesis transactions and administrative attributes immutably recorded
• Phishing Mitigation: Integration with secure origin messaging and verified interactions

Quality and Reliability Assurance
• Immutable Provenance: Corporate Digital Name origin permanently recorded
• Auditability: Complete transaction history for compliance and verification
• Policy Enforcement: DAR-based policies ensure proper data handling

Technical Architecture: Universal Foundation

Corporate Digital Name Integration
• Establishes DBA genesis for all business data manufacturing operations
• Provides legal anchoring using globally established DBA framework
• Bridges physical world corporate existence to Digital Realm operations

Data as an Asset Framework
• Manufactured data carries immutable proof of creation and ownership
• Enables economic recognition of data as balance sheet assets
• Supports new models of digital commerce and value creation

Universal Wallet Compatibility
• Data wallets interoperate with existing wallet infrastructure
• Supports cross-platform data access and verification
• Enables data portability across digital ecosystems

Implementation Notes

This Data Manufacturing process creates the foundational infrastructure where everything gets a wallet. The system supports both basic encryption with key delivery for initial implementations and advanced features like on-chain DAR storage or device attestation for enterprise deployments.

The genesis foundation ensures manufactured data objects carry their own verifiable wallet, enabling new models of interaction, command and control, and digital commerce that work across social media, IoT devices, business operations, and personal data management.

Through the Corporate Digital Name DBA genesis, all manufactured data maintains an unbroken chain of title from the corporate foundation to every system, product, and data object the business creates, ensuring authentic corporate origin and authorized ownership.
