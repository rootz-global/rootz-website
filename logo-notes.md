# Rootz Logo Usage Notes

## Logo File
- The Rootz logo has been provided showing clean green typography with "rootz" in lowercase
- Features distinctive design with the "TM" trademark symbol
- Green color palette aligns perfectly with the website's color scheme

## Implementation Plan
- Logo will be resized and optimized for web use
- Can be implemented as SVG for scalability or optimized PNG for compatibility
- Should replace the text-only "Rootz.Global" branding in the navigation

## Color Coordination
- Logo's green tones should be matched with the website's CSS custom properties
- Primary green (#2d5016) and secondary (#4a7c59) may need adjustment to match logo exactly

## Next Steps
1. Review each individual page for content and design feedback
2. Optimize logo for web implementation
3. Update navigation consistently across all pages at the end
4. Ensure brand consistency between logo and site design
